Source code for the paper "Joint Communications and Sensing Hybrid Beamforming Design via Deep Unfolding," which is available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04376

I have already uploaded the trained models and dataset. The code is ready to run.
- Config the system properly in file system_config. The current configuration is ready for testing.
- Run file main_iter.py to obtain the objective values vs. numbers of iterations/layers.
- Run file main_SNR.py to obtain the rate and beampattern MSEs vs. SNRs.
- Run main_train.py if you want to re-train the models.

Please kindly cite to my paper if you find the code helpful.
